# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

## Description
This project is part of the Higher-Level Programming curriculum at ALX. It involves creating a class hierarchy in Python to build a simplified version of an AirBnB project. The focus is on implementing various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

## Project Details
- **Project Name:** Almost a Circle
- **Language:** Python
- **Author:** Guillaume
- **Weight:** 1

## Project Timeline
- **Start Date:** Jan 11, 2024 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** Jan 16, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Jan 15, 2024 6:00 PM

## Background Context
The project aims to review and reinforce Python concepts including:
- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file

Additionally, the project introduces the following concepts:
- args and kwargs
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain Unit testing and implement it in a large project
- Serialize and deserialize a Class
- Read and write a JSON file
- Understand and use *args and **kwargs
- Handle named arguments in a function

## Copyright - Plagiarism
- Solutions for tasks should be created independently to meet learning objectives
- No content of the project should be published
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files should end with a new line
- First line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules, classes, and functions should be documented
- Documentation should provide a real sentence explaining the purpose

### Python Unit Tests
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should end with a new line
- Test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- Use `unittest` module
- Test files and folders should start with `test_`
- Execute tests using `python3 -m unittest discover tests`

## Tasks
### Task 0: If it's not tested it doesn't work
All files, classes, and methods must be unit tested and PEP 8 validated.

```bash
$ python3 -m unittest discover tests
