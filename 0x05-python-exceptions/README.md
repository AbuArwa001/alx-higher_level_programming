# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## Overview
This school project focuses on learning about Python exceptions and error handling. The project consists of several tasks that aim to reinforce your understanding of exceptions, their usage, and how to handle them in Python.


## Resources
- Errors and Exceptions
- [Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling (starting at minute 7)](#)
  
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without the help of Google:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- The difference between errors and exceptions
- What exceptions are and how to use them
- When to use exceptions
- How to correctly handle an exception
- The purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise a builtin exception
- When to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
### 0. Safe list printing
- Write a function that prints x elements of a list.
- Prototype: `def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):`
- No importing of any module is allowed.
- No use of `len()` is allowed.

### 1. Safe printing of an integers list
- Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
- Prototype: `def safe_print_integer(value):`
- No importing of any module is allowed.
- No use of `type()` is allowed.

### 2. Print and count integers
- Write a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.
- Prototype: `def safe_print_list_integers(my_list=[], x=0):`
- No importing of any module is allowed.
- No use of `len()` is allowed.

### 3. Integers division with debug
- Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.
- Prototype: `def safe_print_division(a, b):`
- No importing of any module is allowed.

### 4. Divide a list
- Write a function that divides element by element 2 lists.
- Prototype: `def list_division(my_list_1, my_list_2, list_length):`
- No importing of any module is allowed.

### 5. Raise exception
- Write a function that raises a type exception.
- Prototype: `def raise_exception():`
- No importing of any module is allowed.

### 6. Raise a message
- Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.
- Prototype: `def raise_exception_msg(message=""):`
- No importing of any module is allowed.
