# 0x14. JavaScript - Web Scraping

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming series. It focuses on web scraping using JavaScript.

## Resources
- Working with JSON data
- The workflow of accessing the attributes of a simply-created JSON object by Jimmy Tran from Cohort 1 - San Francisco
- request module
- Modern JS

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, learners are expected to understand:
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to manipulate JSON data
- How to use request and fetch API
- How to read and write a file using the fs module

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should be semistandard compliant (Rules of Standard + semicolons on top)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`
- The use of `var` is not allowed

## Installation
To use this project, you need to install Node.js and semi-standard:

```sh
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```
## Usage
Each script is designed to demonstrate a concept of JavaScript web scraping:

* 0-readme.js: Reads and prints the content of a file.
* 1-writeme.js: Writes a string to a file.
* 2-statuscode.js: Displays the status code of a GET request.
* 3-starwars_title.js: Prints the title of a Star Wars movie based on episode number.
